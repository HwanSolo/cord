# Colorado Resource Directory

The Colorado Resource Directory (CORD) is a powerful tool for advocates, social workers, and community support members to easily access assistive resources for their clients across the state of Colorado. Other kinds of resource databases can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate. CORD is a seamless and accessible product that has been designed to simplify the process of providing clients the information they need. It is a unique in that it allows helping organizations to filter for the individual needs of their clients, and export this information to a printable document. There are several templates for this process, as different organizations have their own specific needs. 

CORD is, first and foremost, an asset for people who work with clients who are seeking assistive services. As such, open communication is essential to maintaining the best and most accurate information for service providers to disseminate to the public. Users may submit messages through the program in order to update information, add new organizations, delete deprecated material, and ask questions. The foundation of CORD is in the utter necessity of community engagement and an undying faith in the unification of conscientious individuals who seek to contribute daily, through sorrows and joys, to the betterment of this singular earth.

*“We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It’s easy to say, ‘It’s not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem.’ Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people by heroes.”*
-Fred Rogers
